This is **succo_google_quest**, a set of Python scripts to interact with the Google services through the [Google APIs](https://cloud.google.com/apis?hl=en). In particular,
- **succo_photos_quest** analyses the content of the user's [Google Photos](https://www.google.com/intl/en/photos/about/) book, providing information on all the albums and on all the photos/videos that aren't included in any album.
- **succo_mail_quest** allows to create as drafts or send multiple emails iteratively (e.g., to different recipients with custom subjects, bodies, attachments) through [Gmail](https://www.google.com/intl/en/gmail/about/).

This software is intended for those who already have an environment to develop with the Google APIs set up. Details on how to have this step done can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started).
